## 7 Steps to Solve Algorithm Problems

Today, I viewed the video "7 Steps to Solve Algorithm Problems" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell - the author of [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hrctci-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0984782850&linkId=4b0bb75d87b94d4378dd3bd245a7284b) book. In this video, Gayle describe her method for solve algorithms problems which consists 7 steps: listen carefully, example, brute force, optimize, walk through your algorithms, code and test. In this article, I will summary these steps base on what I learned from this video.

### Step 1: Listen carefully

The first step you will take is listen (read) your problem carefully.

### Step 2: Example

Example (make example big, no special cases)

### Step 3: Brute force

(better to have a brute force than nothing at all.

Because

- check that you understand the problem, shows you're at least good enough to get that
- it's good place to optimize from

### Step 4: Optimize

### Step 5: Walk through your algorithms

know exactly what you're going to do before coding

* what variables & data structures?
* how, why, why do they change?
* what is the structure of your code

### Step 6: Code

Whiteboard: write straight, use space wisely

Whiteboard or computer

- coding style matters (consistent braces, consistent variable naming, consistence spaces, descriptive variables)

- modularize (before. not after)

### Step 7: Test

Analyse: think about each line, double check things that look weired/risky (for-loop that decrement, math) - Use test cases (smalle test-cases first (faster to run, you will problably be more thoroguht, edge cases, big tes cases)

REMEMBER:
* think as you test (don't be a bot)
* test your code, not your algorithm
* think before you fix bugs. Don't panic! (wrong fixes are worse than no fix)
