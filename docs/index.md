## What is Python?

> Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

**Python is Interpreted**

Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

**Python is Interactive**

You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

**Python is Object-Oriented**

Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

**Python is a Beginner's Language**

Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
